For each day, where `X` is the day number (1-25):

 - Visit https://adventofcode.com/{year}/day/X/input and copy the contents in your `inputs/dayX/part1.txt` file
 - Implement the necessary logic in `solveForPart1` 
 - Do the same for part 2
 - `npm run start X` to run the day's test
 - `npm test` to run your tests
 - Profit! ðŸŽ‰
